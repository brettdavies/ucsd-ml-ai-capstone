# Capstone Step 10: Design Your Deployment Solution Architecture

## Introduction

Building upon the previously outlined deployment plan ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AtQ6vr4sKrrhf9zp1nxNYUPKS0sFHLJp0Gm_4FdsUWM/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.93lx0v539m3u)) for the Model Testing Framework, this document details the deployment architecture, explaining the design decisions and their rationale. The aim is to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable system that facilitates dataset acquisition, processing, and model evaluation for machine learning practitioners and developers.

## Architecture Overview

### Major Components and Data Flow

The deployment architecture consists of the following major components:

1. User Interface (CLI and API):  
   1. Inputs: User commands, configuration files, and datasets.  
   2. Outputs: Processed data, evaluation results, and logs.  
2. Data Acquisition Module:  
   1. Retrieves datasets from various sources (APIs, databases, file systems).  
3. Data Processing Module:  
   1. Performs data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.  
4. Model Evaluation Module:  
   1. Tests machine learning models against the processed data.  
5. Storage Systems:  
   1. Data Storage: For raw and processed datasets.  
   2. Artifact Storage: For saving evaluation results and logs.  
6. Logging and Monitoring System:  
   1. Collects logs and metrics for performance monitoring and debugging.

### Architecture Diagram

NB: The following is a text description of the architecture diagram.

The architecture diagram is a layered representation showing the flow of data and interactions between components:

* Layer 1: User Interface  
  * Users interact via Command-Line Interface (CLI) or API calls.  
* Layer 2: Application Services  
  * Data Acquisition Module  
  * Data Processing Module  
  * Model Evaluation Module  
* Layer 3: Storage Systems  
  * Connected to application services for data persistence.  
* Layer 4: Infrastructure  
  * Docker Containers: Each module runs in its own container.  
  * Docker Compose: Orchestrates the containers.  
* Layer 5: Monitoring Tools  
  * Logging Service: Collects logs from all containers.  
  * Monitoring Dashboard: Provides real-time metrics.

### Design Decisions and Justifications

**Component-Based Architecture**

- Modularity: Separating functionalities into distinct modules allows for easier maintenance, testing, and scalability.  
- Reusability: Modules can be reused or replaced without affecting the entire system.

**Containerization with Docker**

- Consistency: Ensures the application runs the same way in different environments.  
- Isolation: Modules run in isolated containers, reducing dependency conflicts.  
- Scalability: Containers can be scaled horizontally based on workload.

**Data Storage Solutions**

- Local Storage (for initial deployment): Utilizes the host file system for simplicity.  
- Option for Cloud Storage: Supports integration with cloud services like AWS S3 for larger datasets.  
- Artifact Storage: Stores evaluation results and logs for reproducibility and auditing.

**Data Flow Between Components**

- Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Modules communicate via well-defined APIs and shared volumes.  
- Data Pipelines: Data flows sequentially from acquisition to processing to evaluation, enabling streamlined operations.

**Lifecycle of the ML/DL Model**  
Since the framework focuses on model testing rather than training or deploying a specific model, the model lifecycle considerations are as follows:

- Model Integration: Users bring their own models to be evaluated by the framework.  
- Evaluation Metrics: The framework provides consistent metrics for model assessment.  
- Artifact Management: Evaluation results are stored for comparison over time.

**Logging and Monitoring**

- Centralized Logging: Using tools like Logstash or Fluentd to collect logs from all containers.  
- Monitoring Dashboard: Implementing solutions like Grafana or Kibana for real-time monitoring.  
- Alerting Mechanisms: Configurable alerts for system errors or performance issues.

**Technology Stack**

- Programming Language: Python, for its rich data science and machine learning ecosystem.  
- Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose for deployment.  
- CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.  
- Package Management: Wheel for distributing compiled installation wheels.  
- Version Control: Git and GitHub for source code management.

### Data Storage and Management

Storage Locations

- Raw Data: Stored in a designated /data/raw directory within the container or mapped volume.  
- Processed Data: Stored in /data/processed for use by the evaluation module.  
- Artifacts and Logs: Stored in /artifacts and /logs respectively.

Data Handling

- Data Persistence: Volumes are used to persist data outside of containers, ensuring data is not lost when containers are updated or replaced.  
- Data Security: Access controls and permissions are managed to protect sensitive data.

### System Monitoring and Debugging

- Logging Levels: Configurable levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to control the verbosity of logs.  
- Error Handling: Exceptions are caught and logged with context to facilitate debugging.  
- Health Checks: Regular checks on container status and resource utilization.  
- User Feedback: Error messages and logs are made accessible to users for troubleshooting.

### Estimated Implementation Costs

**Resources**

- Development Time: Estimated 100 hours for development, testing, and documentation.  
- Human Resources: One developer (myself).  
- Computing Resources: Standard development machine with Docker installed; no specialized hardware required.

**Financial Costs**

- Infrastructure: Minimal costs if using local machines. Optional costs for cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure) if scaling is required.  
- Hosting: Free hosting on GitHub for code and Docker Hub for images (public repositories).  
- Monitoring Tools: Open-source tools like Grafana and Prometheus to avoid licensing fees.

### Handling Edge and Stress Cases

**Scalability**

- Horizontal Scaling: Additional containers can be spawned to handle increased workload.  
- Load Balancing: Implementing load balancers if the framework is deployed in a distributed environment.

**Fault Tolerance**

- Container Restart Policies: Configure Docker to automatically restart failed containers.  
- Data Backup: Regular backups of data volumes to prevent data loss.

**Resilience**

- Graceful Degradation: The system continues to operate in a limited capacity if certain modules fail.  
- Timeouts and Retries: Implementing timeouts for external calls and retry mechanisms for transient failures.

### Alternative Architectures

**Cloud-Based Deployment**

- Serverless Functions: Using AWS Lambda or Azure Functions for on-demand execution.  
- Managed Container Services: Deploying on Kubernetes clusters for advanced orchestration.

Pros:

- Scalability and high availability.  
- Managed services reduce maintenance overhead.

Cons:

- Increased complexity.  
- Potential costs associated with cloud services.

**On-Premises Deployment**

- Virtual Machines: Deploying the framework on VMs within an organization’s infrastructure.

Pros:

- Greater control over the environment.  
- Data remains within the organization’s network.

Cons:

- Requires more setup and maintenance.  
- Scaling is limited by physical hardware.
