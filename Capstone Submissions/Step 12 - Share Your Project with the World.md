# Capstone Step 12: Share Your Project with the World

## Introduction

For my capstone project, I developed data collection and model testing framework applications designed to facilitate dataset acquisition, processing, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model evaluation for machine learning practitioners and developers. This framework addresses the challenges of testing machine learning audio transcription models across diverse datasets and configurations, providing a standardized environment for evaluation and comparison.

## GitHub Repository
