# Capstone Proposal Step 3: Real-Time Audio Transcription for Live Sports

### Problem

This capstone project will address the challenge of accurately transcribing live sports commentary in real-time. This problem is particularly interesting because it involves dealing with rapid speech, overlapping dialogues, and a significant amount of domain-specific vocabulary and jargon, often not handled well by general-purpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models. For instance, in a baseball game, terms like “double play,” “ERA,” or player names are unique to the context and can be difficult for standard ASR models to transcribe accurately. By improving transcription accuracy, this project aims to provide better accessibility and enhanced user experience for sports enthusiasts, commentators, and broadcasters.

### Why is it interesting?

Accurate real-time transcription of live sports commentary has a significant real-world impact, especially for baseball. It can make live sports content accessible to individuals with hearing impairments and enhance the overall viewing experience by providing instant and accurate captions. The technical challenges involved, such as handling various accents, background noise, and the need for low-latency processing, make this project particularly interesting. Solving these challenges will push the boundaries of current ASR technology and showcase its potential in high-stakes, real-time applications.

### Data Required

To solve this problem, the project requires a comprehensive dataset that includes high-quality audio recordings of previous baseball games, transcripts of these games, and a domain-specific vocabulary dataset.

1\. Audio Recordings: The primary data source will be high-quality audio recordings of past baseball games. These recordings should cover different teams, commentators, and game situations to provide a diverse dataset for training the ASR model.

2\. Transcripts: Accurate transcripts of these audio recordings are necessary for supervised learning. These transcripts will serve as the ground truth for training and evaluating the ASR model.

3\. Domain-Specific Vocabulary: A dataset of domain-specific vocabulary that includes terms and phrases commonly used in baseball, as well as names of players, teams, and commentators, will be essential. This dataset will help in addressing the Proper Noun problem and improve the transcription accuracy of the ASR model.

### Data Acquisition

The required data can be acquired from various sources:

1\. Publicly Available Archives: Several online archives and databases provide access to baseball game recordings and transcripts. Websites like Baseball Reference offer extensive historical data on baseball games, including detailed play-by-play descriptions.

2\. Sports Broadcasting Networks: Collaborating with sports broadcasting networks can provide access to high-quality audio recordings and professional transcripts of baseball games. Networks like ESPN, MLB Network, and regional sports channels are valuable resources for obtaining relevant data.

3\. Online Sports Databases: Online databases such as MLB.com and Baseball-Reference offer a wealth of information on baseball games, including player statistics, game summaries, and audio recordings.

4\. Web Scraping: Web scraping techniques can extract audio recordings and transcripts from various sports-related websites and online platforms. This approach can help in gathering a diverse dataset from multiple sources.

5\. Collaboration with Sports Organizations: Partnering with sports organizations, teams, and commentators can provide access to exclusive audio recordings and detailed transcripts. Such collaborations can also help curate a comprehensive and up-to-date domain-specific vocabulary dataset.

### Approach

The approach to solving this problem will involve several detailed steps:

1\. Data Collection: Audio recordings and transcripts of past baseball games will be collected from sources such as Baseball Reference, MLB.com, and sports broadcasting networks. The aim is to gather diverse recordings that include different teams, commentators, and game situations. This step ensures that the model is trained on a representative dataset.

2\. Data Preprocessing: The collected audio data will be cleaned to remove noise and standardized to a uniform format. Techniques such as spectral gating will enhance audio quality by reducing background noise. The transcripts will be aligned with the audio recordings to create a synchronized dataset for training.

3\. Feature Extraction: Relevant audio features, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), will be extracted from the recordings. MFCCs are widely used in ASR systems as they effectively represent the power spectrum of the audio signal, making it easier for the model to learn from the data.

4\. Model Selection: A base ASR model, like Whisper, will be chosen for further development. Whisper is known for its robustness in noisy environments and ability to handle diverse accents. Its architecture can be fine-tuned to improve its performance in the specific domain of baseball commentary.

5\. Incorporate Domain-Specific Vocabulary: The model’s vocabulary will be enhanced by adding domain-specific terms and proper nouns related to baseball. This step addresses the Proper Noun problem in NLP by ensuring that the model can accurately recognize and transcribe baseball-specific jargon. Techniques such as subword tokenization will be used to manage the vocabulary efficiently.

6\. Model Fine-Tuning: The ASR model will be fine-tuned on the curated dataset using transfer learning techniques. Transfer learning allows me to leverage Whisper’s pre-trained capabilities and adapt them to the specific domain of live sports commentary. Fine-tuning will involve adjusting the model’s parameters to improve accuracy and reduce the Word Error Rate (WER).

7\. Real-Time Processing Optimization: Techniques such as beam search decoding and latency reduction methods will be implemented to ensure the model operates in real-time. Beam search decoding enhances transcription accuracy by exploring multiple possible transcriptions simultaneously. Latency reduction methods will optimize the model’s performance to meet the low-latency requirements of live transcription.

8\. Model Evaluation: The model’s performance will be evaluated using standard metrics like Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and real-time factor (RTF). Evaluation will be conducted on a test set with diverse audio samples to ensure the model’s robustness. Based on the evaluation results, iterative improvements will be made to enhance the model’s accuracy and efficiency.

9\. Model Compression and Quantization: To enable the model to run on a wide variety of hardware, techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation will be applied. Model pruning will reduce the number of parameters by removing redundant weights. Quantization will convert the model’s weights from 32-bit floating point to 8-bit integers, significantly reducing the model size and computational requirements. Knowledge distillation will involve training a smaller “student” model to mimic the performance of the larger “teacher” model, thereby reducing the overall model complexity without sacrificing accuracy.

10\. Integration and Deployment: The final model will be integrated into an embedded (offline, on-device) application. This command-line executable will include an API for real-time transcription and offer a real-time display of transcriptions with options to download the transcript. The deployment will ensure that the model can be easily integrated with other applications and used by broadcasters and commentators. The embedded nature of the solution will enable it to run efficiently on devices with limited hardware resources, such as smartphones and tablets, ensuring broad accessibility.
