# Capstone Step 1: Planning

## Real-Time Audio Transcription with ASR for Live Events

### Problem

The first capstone project idea involves leveraging an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model to transcribe audio from live events in real-time. The primary goal is to enhance transcription accuracy by fine-tuning an existing ASR model with a dataset curated explicitly for the context of live events. This includes incorporating domain-specific vocabulary, such as names of speakers, technical terms, and event-specific jargon, to address the Proper Noun problem in NLP.

### Data Required

The data required for this project would include high-quality audio recordings of live events, transcripts of these events for training and validation purposes, and a dataset of domain-specific vocabulary relevant to the events being transcribed.

## Automated Medical Diagnosis System

### Problem

Develop an AI system capable of diagnosing medical conditions based on patient symptoms. This system aims to assist healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely diagnoses, especially in cases where specialized expertise may not be readily available.

### Data Required

A comprehensive dataset containing patient symptoms, medical history, laboratory test results, and corresponding diagnoses should cover various medical conditions and include diverse demographic information.

## Smart Energy Management System for Buildings

### Problem

Create an AI-powered system to optimize energy consumption in commercial and residential buildings. Analyzing usage patterns, occupancy data, weather forecasts, and building characteristics will reduce energy waste, lower costs, and minimize environmental impact.

### Data Required

Historical energy usage data for buildings, including electricity, gas, and water consumption. Data on building occupancy schedules, weather conditions, building infrastructure (such as HVAC systems), and energy prices are also needed for accurate modeling and prediction.
